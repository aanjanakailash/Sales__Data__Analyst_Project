# 📊 Sales Data Analytics Project

> End-to-end data analytics pipeline — from raw Excel/CSV files to an interactive Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow using **Python (Pandas)**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**.  
Raw sales data is cleaned, queried, and visualized across a 3-page interactive dashboard.

## 🗃️ Data Sources

| File | Description | Key Columns |
|---|---|---|
| `mainsales2.csv` | Main sales transactions (fact table) | SaleID, CustomerID, ProductID, CityID, Amount, Date |
| `customer.csv` | Customer dimension table | CustomerID, Name, Age, Segment |
| `product.csv` | Product dimension table | ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price |
| `city.csv` | City/location dimension table | CityID, City, State, Region |

## ⚙️ Workflow

### Step 1 — Data Cleaning with Python (Pandas)

**Notebook:** `notebooks/data_cleaning.ipynb`

- Loaded all 4 raw CSV/Excel files into Pandas DataFrames
- Removed duplicate rows from each table
- Handled missing/null values — filled or dropped based on column importance
- Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores, no spaces)
- Fixed incorrect data types (e.g., dates parsed as strings → datetime)
- Removed leading/trailing whitespace from text columns
- Validated foreign keys — ensured CustomerID, ProductID, CityID matched across tables
- Exported cleaned files to `data/cleaned/`

---

### Step 2 — SQL Analysis

**File:** `sql/queries.sql`

After cleaning, data was loaded into a SQL database (SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL) and the following queries were run:

- Total sales revenue by city and region
- Top 10 best-selling products by revenue and quantity
- Customer segmentation analysis (high/medium/low value customers)
- Month-over-month and year-over-year sales trends
- Sales performance by product category
- Average order value per customer segment
- Revenue contribution by city tier
- JOIN queries across all 4 tables to build a master sales view

---

### Step 3 — Power BI Dashboard

**File:** `dashboard/sales_dashboard.pbix`

Cleaned data was imported into Power BI.  
Relationships were set between all 4 tables using their respective ID columns.  
DAX measures were created for KPIs like Total Revenue, Avg Order Value, and Growth %.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Pages

## 📌 Future Improvements

- [ ] Automate the data cleaning pipeline using a Python script (`.py`) instead of just a notebook
- [ ] Schedule SQL queries using Apache Airflow or a simple cron job
- [ ] Add Python-based visualizations (Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly) as an alternative to Power BI
- [ ] Connect Power BI directly to a live SQL database instead of CSV imports
- [ ] Add a machine learning model to forecast future sales (using Scikit-learn)
- [ ] Deploy the dashboard to Power BI Service for online sharing
- [ ] Add data validation tests using `Great Expectations` library
